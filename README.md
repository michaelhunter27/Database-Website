# MMO Database Management Website

## About
This project is a website front end and server back end for managing a database for a fictional MMORPG called Mega Magic Online.  It supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for the various database tables.

This project was developed in collaboration with [Ryan Giard](https://github.com/Ryan-Giard) for a Databases class (CS 340) at Oregon State University.  This repository is a personal fork for the purpose of showcasing the project.  You can find the original repo [here](https://github.com/Ryan-Giard/Project-Step-2-Draft).
